# String Calculator - TDD Kata in Ruby

## Whatâ€™s This About?

This project is my solution to the classic String Calculator kata, built using Ruby and the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. The idea is simple: given a string with numbers separated by delimiters, your calculator adds them all up!

I tackled this step-by-step, starting from the basics and adding features as I wrote tests to guide each change.

## What Can It Do?

- Returns 0 if you give it an empty string.
- Handles one or more numbers separated by commas.
- Also understands new lines (`\n`) as separators.
- Lets you specify your own delimiter, for example: `//;\n1;2` sums to 3.
- Throws a friendly error if negative numbers show up, listing every negative number.
- Ignores numbers bigger than 1000 instead of adding them.

## How To Run The Tests

If you want to try it yourself, make sure Ruby and Bundler are installed, then run:

--> bundle install
--> bundle exec rspec

You should see all tests passing smoothly.

## How I Built This - My TDD Journey

I started by writing the simplest test possible - that an empty string should return 0. Then, I gradually added tests for:

- Single numbers
- Two or more numbers
- Newline as an extra delimiter
- Custom delimiters
- Handling negatives with exceptions
- Ignoring numbers over 1000

For every test that passed, I refactored the code to keep it clean and simple. I also committed after each meaningful step, so you can track how the code evolved.

If you want, check out the tests and the implementation to see how the problem was tackled in small, manageable steps. This is a great way to practice writing readable, testable code while embracing the TDD mindset.
